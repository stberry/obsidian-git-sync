This meeting is a catch up meeting for UKCM PT 10th meeting.

PC is modifying, it will send to Jonathan next week.

Discussion items
- Test dataset
	- S-164 Micklefirth testbed
	- S-164 test datasets include base standard symbols
	- Catagrophic cell
	- required static dataset
	- can find out GI registry(IHO site)
	- not support GML now, but it can be support soon (9 month?)
	- can create dataset for portrayal
	- what can we do? (S129 PT member)
	- testing manual(screenshot type approval)
		- test description, setup, action, results(screenshots including scales co-working with S-164 team)
		- sketches the domain (product specification, usecases)
		- Jason has making a usecase document (draft)
	- push the cell -> exchange set / very simple to do
	- negotiate it on next week meeting

- S-129 Portrayal catalogue
	- current 1.1.0
	- new 1.2.0
		- some new linstyle, symbol
	- it is not uploaded on GI registry, ask to Jeff
	- plain boundary? or symbolized boundary?
		- optional property to user / testing symbolized boudnary is hard

- GML schema generation using CARIS?
	- Jonathan provide the GML schema 
- Interoperability (S-128)
	- will discuss in TSM (in two weeks)



Summary (summarized by Jason Rhee)

1. S-129 GML schema
	- Please find attached S-129 Ed. 1.1.0 FC and GML schema.
	- Much appreciated, Jonathan, if yourself and Hugh can generate the GML schema for comparison and improvement.
	- As discussed, Ed 1.1.0 does not comprise the UKCM area boundary, which we aim to include under 1.2.0. (Mock up “UKCM area.png” attached).
	- Kevin, Hoyeon – if you think the attached do not reflect the correct versions, please do let us know.

2. S-164
	- The main purpose of S-164 is type approval testing.
	- What the S-164 Subgroup requires from the S-129 PT is advice on what’s representative of S-129 datasets under different scenarios
		- I.e. Descriptions of use cases, and screenshots/sketches of corresponding S-129 data.
	- From there the S-164 Subgroup can create test datasets and test them by loading onto testbed software via exchange sets.
	- Test datasets under S-164 are static datasets used to test the loading on, and interaction with, ENCs, as well as interoperability with other products etc.

3. UKCM boundary
	 - In addition to the symbolised version depicted by the attached mock up “UKCM area.png”, a plain version line style needs to be included in the PC.
	 - This is so end users can toggle on and off the symbolised line style of the boundary.

4. Test/Viewer software
	- ShoreECDIS does not support GML datasets.
	- KHOA Viewer is likely the more suitable software for viewing and testing GML datasets, including S-129.

5. Exchange sets
	- As per (2) above, the S-164 subgroup will produce exchange sets for the purpose of testing.
	- Operationally, data producers would be responsible for producing exchange sets, via which datasets are provided to end user systems.
	- However, different scenarios of data exchange need to be considered. This is to be discussed after 10th S-129 PT meeting.
