[Session 2]
1. Necessary S-129 updates
	- FC & GML schema (KMOU)
		- some attribute and definition was updated as the following notes.
		- after update, Raphael was look around quickly, it has some minor issues. (currently, it is clear)
		- Jason said it needs to compare KMOU's schema and RM's schema, but it is unnecessary because the KMOU's schema apply the RM's comment.
		  (just )
		- the uom and constraints should be discussed
		- addnitional update?
	- <!--update notes>
	- https://www.diffchecker.com/rLLIBP8Q/

	1. uptdate metadata such as versionNumber, versionDate, etc.
	2. update definition of simple attributes (come from description of PS document).
	3. correct misspeelled feature name: Scale Minimum
	4. update uom that Maximum Draught / Expected Passing Speed / Distance Above UKC Limit
		- it needs to discuss about adding uom and constraint
		- uom and constraint update example (from S-101)
				<S100FC:S100_FC_SimpleAttribute>
				<S100FC:name>Depth Range Maximum Value</S100FC:name>
				<S100FC:definition>The maximum (deepest) value of a depth range.</S100FC:definition>
				<S100FC:code>depthRangeMaximumValue</S100FC:code>
				<S100FC:remarks>Where the area dries, the value is negative or zero (0).</S100FC:remarks>
				<S100FC:alias>DRVAL2</S100FC:alias>
				<S100FC:definitionReference>
					<S100FC:sourceIdentifier>821</S100FC:sourceIdentifier>
					<S100FC:definitionSource ref="IHOREG" />
				</S100FC:definitionReference>
				<S100FC:valueType>real</S100FC:valueType>
				<S100FC:uom>
					<S100Base:name>metre</S100Base:name>
					<S100Base:symbol>m</S100Base:symbol>
				</S100FC:uom>
				<S100FC:quantitySpecification>otherQuantity</S100FC:quantitySpecification>
				<S100FC:constraints>
					<S100CD:textPattern>sxxxxx.xx; s = sign, negative values only</S100CD:textPattern>
					<S100CD:range>
						<S100Base:lowerBound>-30</S100Base:lowerBound>
						<S100Base:upperBound>12500</S100Base:upperBound>
						<S100Base:closure>openInterval</S100Base:closure>
					</S100CD:range>
				</S100FC:constraints>
				
	5. comparision with S100FC, S100CI, S100CD schema documenation (using diffchecker).
	6. XSD update (no change, just change version number)
	
	pull request : I have incorporated the feedback provided by Raphael and made the necessary revisions accordingly. <!-->
2. Suggested S-129 updates
	<Separate feature for UKCM plan area (suggested by KMOU, UKCM PT 10)>
	- Hannu, Dr. Edward agreed this idea.

	<"Input data correctness" indication>
	- Julius, 
	- Hannu, it is not correct way to do, data quality is for publication so don't care? also it is researching in S-98
	- Edward, Data quality issue, move on DQ WG

[Session 3]
- S-129 Portrayal updates
  ![[Pasted image 20240430223158.png]]![[Pasted image 20240430223715.png]]
	- portrayal "route", PC update by Gyeongmin JO(Bluemap)
- S-129 Dataset Cancellation
	- what is data cancellation?
	- difference of data update and data cancellation
		- data update: 기존 데이터셋의 내용 중 일부를 변경하는 것
		- data cancellation: 데이터셋 전체를 파기하는 것, replace to new dataset
		- S-100 표준에서는 기본적으로 전체데이터셋을 대체하는 방식을 사용, 데이터 일관성 유지와 관리 측면에서 더 용이함
		- 하지만 incremental update of Dataset(부분 갱신)을 선택적으로 허용, 이 경우 갱신내용만을 별도의 파일로 전송, 상세한 규격과 구현에 대한 정의가 필요함
- S-129 TDS

[Session 4]
- Routing
  ![[Pasted image 20240430212435.png]]![[Pasted image 20240430213046.png]]
	- sourceRouteName, sourceRouteVersion is described in S-129 PS as attribute remarks that using value of S-421, so it needs to modify.
	- consider Interoperability identifier, is the S-421 mandatory? it is not, then remark update comment, add "for example", for now it feels forced.
	- MRN is IALA concept, keep their data type.
- Technical Service Specification (Thomas Christensen)
	- is there connection with the Maritime Connectivity Platform (MCP)?
	- 

- S-100 validation(Liz Hahessy, DMA)
  ![[Pasted image 20240430220415.png]]![[Pasted image 20240430220553.png]]![[Pasted image 20240430220805.png]]![[Pasted image 20240430221138.png]]![[Pasted image 20240430221739.png]]![[Pasted image 20240430221952.png]]
	- https://github.com/iho-ohi/S-100-Validation-Checks
	- it is not all S-100 validation test, initially focused on ECDIS products/services
	- Overlap with S-98 and S-164 Test data sets, so work closely together.
	- S-158: S-100 validation
	- Coordinate "cross-product validation" with s-98/s-164 lead DQWG, and S-1xx PS owners.
	- Raphael is in the S-100 validation check group, so he can help a lot for S-129 PT.
